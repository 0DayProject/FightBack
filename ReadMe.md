ZeroDay: Fightback

A long time ago, the pioneers traveled to many wonderful worlds from the great Ethereum world, through the fog-shrouded memory pool.

Now, we fantasize about traveling through alternate universes, freely traversing Arbitrum, Optimism, and admiring the majestic landscapes of Matic and Avalanche.

However, the fate from another dimension has erected barriers between the various public chains, and the danger and fragility of cross-chain bridges have also discouraged travelers.

Therefore, those brave explorers who were exiled to Layer 2 decided to resist the arrangement of fate and wanted to find the Holy Grail that can cross-chains freely, so that they could return to Layer 1 to fight back against fate.

Yes, they did because of @LayerZero_Labs.
